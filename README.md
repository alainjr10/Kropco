Agriculture is the strength of Cameroon's economy, engaging an estimated 70% of the country's economically active population. Farming has been a huge weapon in the fight against poverty and employment in our country.

But In spite of the enormous potential of the agricultural sector, the average farmer faces a chain of difficulties that significantly comprise their abililty to keep up with the country's food demands.

## Three of the major problems Cameroonian farmers face everyday are;

-> Lack of equipment from crop analysis, a leading cause of poor farm output
-> The absence of storage facilities for perishable goods produced in large quantities, leading to tremendous losses in farm produce. This is often a  hard loss for farmers.
-> Slow access to market and very little price regulation policies to protect the interest of the farmers.

That's what we created Kropco, an application that provides a chain of solutions to Cameroonian farmers. We believe that Kropco is the product that will help farmers produce more, preserve more, and sell more. 

## Our Solution
Kropco is a mobile application developed with a combination of Google's Flutter and Firebase technologies. The application provides three major services to farmers:

First, we've developed a working model that uses standard imaging techniques, allowing farmers to evaluate the health conditions of their crops. With this feature, farmers can use affordable phone Cameras to take pictures of their crops, to find out what diseases are attacking their crops, and how to deal with them.

The next and most important service is the provision of storage facilities for farmers to preserve their perishable goods in large quantities. We're using the Google maps technology to help farmers find the storage facilities, especially those nearby. We also let farmers assess the state of the available storage facilities, to determine if there is sufficient room for their produce aforehand. This is to limit the number of travels farmers have to perform to get their products into safe hands.

Finally, we're offering farmers a community where they can easily market their products and set pricepoints to protect their interests. This is important to help farmers enjoy the fruits of their harvest, and alleviate poverty.

# What Sustainable UN development goals are we solving?

# Our solution allows us to solve the following UN development goals:

1. Poverty: Through Kropco, farmers will increase farm output by limiting crop disease and crop loss. Farmers will also have storage facilities for the products, reducing loss. This is a major step towards alleviating poverty in Cameroon.

2. Hunger: A good way to reduce the hunger problem is to increase food production. Kropco through it's three major services helps farmers produce more, so they can feed many more Cameroonians, and Africans.

Kropco is a game changer for the agricultural industry in Cameroon!
